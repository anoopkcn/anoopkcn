## Test

This page defines the blog section and lists all posts in it.

A "site section" in Zine is a group of pages that form a logical subtree of the
website. It's related to directory structure, but it's not an entirely 1:1 mapping.

```py
def hello():
    print("hello")
```

Take also a look at `layouts/blog.shtml` to get an idea of how to render a page
list in a SuperHTML template.

```=katex
H\psi = E\psi
```
alternatives

```ziggy
.alternatives = [{
    .name = "rss",
    .layout = "rss.xml",
    .output = "index.xml",
}],
```
