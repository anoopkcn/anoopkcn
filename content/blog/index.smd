This page defines the blog section and lists all posts in it.

A "site section" in Zine is a group of pages that form a logical subtree of the
website. It's related to directory structure, but it's not an entirely 1:1 mapping.

```py
def hello():
    print("hello")
```
What defines a site section in Zine is the presence of `index.smd` files. You
can learn more [in the official Zine docs](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/).

Take also a look at `layouts/blog.shtml` to get an idea of how to render a page
list in a SuperHTML template.
